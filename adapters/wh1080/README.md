# WH1080 Weather Station Adapter

This adapter is based on the work of @haricotbean. It is based on others, mostly
in @jim-easterbrook pywws project (https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws) for
WH1080 and derivated weather stations. So, this is only a bit refactor and a
very small contribution to work of a lot of people.

Here you have more information about this adapter and the weather stations
that can be useful to understand how it works, solve problems or know the work
of the other people:

## Tested models:
There are a lot of *Fine Offset* weather station models. Feel free to contribute
with your model to ensure that this adapter works properly:
* PCE-FWS 20

## Credits:
* @jim-easterbrook (pywws and other contributions)
* @haricotbean (port to node)
* @terox (refactoring to adapter approach)

A lot of people that contribute releasing the protocol or explain it.

Thank you very much to each one.
